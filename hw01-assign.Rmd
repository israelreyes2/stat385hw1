## Note on Markdown

If you need help with markdown syntax, please go to the "Help" menu and select the 
_Markdown Quick Reference_ guide. This will open in the **Help** tab on
the _lower-right_ corner of _RStudio_. For more examples, please see 
[the literate programming slides](http://stat385.stat.illinois.edu/lectures/02-literate-programming/02-literate-programming.pdf#page=26) and the  [in class examples of writing in _RMarkdown_](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/fb36l0isvhoko8e/08-31-2018-rmarkdown-sample.Rmd?dl=0).

In addition, the following _three_ [RStudio Cheatsheets](http://rstudio.com/cheatsheets) 
will be helpful:

- [RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf)
- [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
- [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)

All of these cheatsheets will be given to you during your time in the CBTF.

## Note on Tutorial Videos

You may find it helpful to reference the tutorial videos related to working
with GitHub and RStudio Cloud.

```{r}
pkg_list = c("rmarkdown")
```

# Assignment

### Collaborators

If you worked with any other student in preparing these answers, please
make sure to list their full names and NetIDs (e.g. `FirstName LastName (NetID)` ).

## (12 points) Exercise 0: Get aboard the GitHub Bus!

- **[2 Points] (a)** Place a link to your `hw01` GitHub repository here.


- **[5 Points] (b)** Commit every exercise as you finish them. There are
    _five_ exercises (including this one).

- **[5 Points] (c)** Make each commit message _meaningful_. 
    - The bare minimum for a "meaningful" commit is a length of 15 characters.
    - Inside the commit message, please make sure to appropriately describe 
      what is happening.
          - Simply stating, "Exercise 3" or "Ex3" is not sufficient.
    - Provide detail on what _changed_. 
    
## (2 points) Exercise 1: Homework Policy

Please uncomment the following statement when you have read and agreed
to the [homework policy](http://stat385.stat.illinois.edu/syllabus/#homework/).
To _uncomment_ a statement in _RMarkdown_ delete the `<!-- -->` surrounding
the content.

<!-- 

I have read and agree to abide by the policies and procedures laid 
out by the [homework policy](http://stat385.stat.illinois.edu/syllabus/#homework/).
                               
I understand that:

- I must independently write up solutions to homework problems.
    - Failure to do so will result in an academic integrity violation due to 
      plagarism and more severe penalties.
- I must list the names of all collaborators that I work with at the top of
  my homework assignment.
- I understand that I can work with **at most** three other students in class. 
- I must update the "author" field at the top of the homework assignments to
  include my full name and netid.
- I will change the name of the Rmd file from `hwXX-assign.Rmd` to 
  `hwXX-NetId.Rmd` and ensure the output file is appropriately named in a similar
  fashion.
- I will turn in my homework by committing to the GitHub repository that was
  setup for me.
    - There is no paper or e-mail turn-in available. 
- I must make all commits using `git` and _not_ the GitHub web interface.
    - If I do, I will lose all the points associated with the `git` commits.
- I must have relevant commit messages that **are longer than 15 characters**
  to receive git commit description points.
- I will be able to drop **one** homework assignment over the course of the 
  semester. 
- I understand that any academic integrity violations (cheating or assisting others)
  will be punished to ensure a fair academic environment for all.
